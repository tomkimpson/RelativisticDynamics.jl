Welcome to RelativisticDynamics.jl!

The focus of this package is to numerically solve orbital equations for the Kerr spacetime.

Please see the [documentation](https://tomkimpson.github.io/RelativisticDynamics.jl/dev/).

## Relativistic spin orbital dynamics

The primary focus of this package is the calculation of the orbital motion of a spinning astrophysical body, such as a pulsar, on a background Kerr spacetime. 

The code solves a set of ODEs numerically. These equations are based on the original works of [Mathisson 1937](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10714-010-0939-y), [Papapetrou 1951](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1951.0200) and [Dixon 1964](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1964NCim...34..317D). Consequently these equations are known as the [MPD equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathisson%E2%80%93Papapetrou%E2%80%93Dixon_equations). More recent works can be found in [Mashoon & Singh 2006](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608278), [Singh 2005](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.72.084033), [Singh, Wu & Sarty 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7171) and [Li,Wu & Singh 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03146).Additional interesting discussion on the motion of extended bodies in GR can be found in [Costa & Nat√°rio, 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6443)


## Spherical Photon Orbits

Spherical photon orbits are also included, mainly as a test case/toy model to ensure the code machinery works as expected.

The general description of the equations of motion is described in [Teo 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003GReGr..35.1909T/abstract) which have been reframed here via a Hamiltonian formalism c.f. [Pu et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02063)





# Getting started 

```
using RelativisticDynamics
solution,model = orbit();
```
`solution` is the time evolution of the variables $x^{\mu}, p^{\mu}, s^{\mu}$. `model` is a struct containing a copy of all the settings that were used to generate that solution.

All user-defined parameters are set in `system_parameters.jl`. Default values can be overridden by passing to `orbit()` e.g.

```
solution,model = orbit(NF=Float32,model=:MPD)
```
