Welcome to RelativisticDynamics.jl!

The focus of this package is to numerically solve orbital equations for the Kerr spacetime.





Please see the [documentation](https://tomkimpson.github.io/RelativisticDynamics.jl/dev/)



## Spherical Photon Orbits

The spherical photon orbits are included as a test case or toy model to ensure the code machinery works as expected.

The general description of the equations of motion is described in [Teo 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003GReGr..35.1909T/abstract) which have been reframed here via a Hamiltonian formalism c.f. [Pu et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02063)
