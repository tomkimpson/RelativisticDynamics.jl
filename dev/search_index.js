The code solves a set of ODEs numerically. These equations are based on the original works of Mathisson 1937, Papapetrou 1951 and Dixon 1964. Consequently these equations are known as the MPD equations. More recent works can be found in Mashoon & Singh 2006, Singh 2005, Singh, Wu & Sarty 2014 and Li,Wu & Singh 2019.
