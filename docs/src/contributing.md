# Contributing

We welcome any contributions to this package. 

Some recommended areas are:

* Taking the [MPD Equations](MPD.md) beyond second order in the expansion.
* Extension to general spin supplementary conditions, beyond. 
* Generalisation to arbitrary spacetime metrics, not just Kerr.
* Calculation of gravitational waveforms using e.g. [numerical kludge](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0607007) approach (or other).
* Extension to hyperbolic systems, e.g. [Li et. al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03494).

Contributions in other areas are also more than welcome - please just [open a pull request](https://github.com/tomkimpson/RelativisticDynamics.jl/pulls) .
